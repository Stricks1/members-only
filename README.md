# Authentication

## Description

On this project we created a members-only blog for Rails using devise to authenticate Users

## Instructions

You can get a local copy of the repository, for it please run the following commands on your terminal:

```
\$ cd <folder>

\$ git clone git@github.com:Stricks1/members-only.git
```

To test the Authentication you can run the server with rails server and navigate to: 
- http://localhost:3000/

When logged in the user will be able to see who created the post, otherwise he just see the post without an Author.
